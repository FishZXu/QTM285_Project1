{"body":"# Gallagher Electoral Disproportionality Data\r\n## 121 Countries, 1945-2011\r\n\r\nChristopher Gandrud  \r\n\r\nData Updated: 4 October 2012\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is it?\r\n\r\nThis is a <strong>.csv</strong> formatted data set of the Least Squares Index of electoral disproportionality for 121 countries between 1945 and 2011. The Least Squares Index is also commonly referred to as the Gallagher Index. The data set combines Michael Gallagher's recently updated data ([here](http://www.tcd.ie/Political_Science/staff/michael_gallagher/ElSystems/Docts/ElectionIndices.pdf)) with some holes (see below) filled in with data made available by John Carey and Simon Hix ([here](http://www.dartmouth.edu/~jcarey/Data_Archive.html)).\r\n\r\n## Why did I make this?\r\n\r\nThere is currently no complete and recently updated Gallagher Index data freely available in a format that is easy to do statistical analysis on. The data on Michael Gallagher's [website](http://www.tcd.ie/Political_Science/staff/michael_gallagher/ElSystems/Docts/ElectionIndices.pdf) has been recently updated (the one I used was from 21 February 2012). However it is only available in PDF format; not exactly the easiest format to merge into an R or Stata file. \r\n\r\nSo, after going through the somewhat painstaking work of entering all of this data into a .csv file (and filling in some holes with Carey and Hix's data) I decided to make my efforts publicly available. Hopefully, this will free up some research time for more productive endeavours than copying and pasting data from a PDF file.\r\n\r\n## Import into R\r\n\r\nTo import the file directly into **R** simply use the following set of commands:\r\n\r\n```r\r\nlibrary(RCurl)\r\nlibrary(foreign)\r\n\r\nurl <- \"https://raw.github.com/christophergandrud/Disproportionality_Data/master/Disproportionality.csv\"\r\n\r\ndisproportionality.data <- getURL(url)                \r\n                            \r\ndisproportionality.data <- read.csv(textConnection(disproportionality.data))\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf this code produces an `SSL certificate problem` error, please see [this blog post](http://christophergandrud.blogspot.com/2012/06/update-to-data-on-github-post-solution.html) for a solution.\r\n\r\n## More details on the Gallagher Index\r\n\r\nThe Least Squares or Gallagher Index of electoral disproportionality basically uses the standard least squares method for comparing the relationship between two samples. It compares parties' votes to the legislative seats they are given. Higher numbers on the Gallagher Index indicate that there is a greater disparity between votes and seats, i.e. elections have produced more disproportional outcomes. A Gallagher score of 0 would indicated that the election produced perfectly proportional outcomes.\r\n\r\nFor more information see: \r\n\r\n> Gallagher, Michael. 1991. “Proportionality, Disproportionality, and Electoral Systems.” Electoral Studies 10(1): 33–41.\r\n\r\n> Carey, John M, and Simon Hix. 2011. “The Electoral Sweet Spot: Low-Magnitude Proportional Electoral Systems.” American Journal of Political Science 55(2): 383–397.\r\n\r\n## Citation\r\n\r\nIf you use this data set please cite the two articles by Gallagher and Carey/Hix. It would also be great if you could cite the working paper I created the combined data set for:\r\n\r\n> Gandrud, Christopher/ 2012.

This included:\r\n\r\nFiji uses September election for 1977 (previous election was in September)  \r\n\r\nFrance uses November election for 1946 (previous election was in June)  \r\n\r\nGreece uses November election for 1989 (previous election was in June)  \r\n\r\nIceland uses October election for 1959 (previous election was in June)  \r\n\r\nIreland uses November Election for 1983 (previous election was in February)  \r\n\r\nMoldova uses July elections for 2009 (previous election was in April)  \r\n\r\nSt Lucia uses April 30 for 1987 (previous election was in April 6)  \r\n\r\nUnited Kingdom uses October Election for 1974 (previous election was in February)  \r\n\r\nThe United States data is for House elections. I did not included data on executive disproportionality, though Gallagher includes this in his PDF file.\r\n \r\n\r\n### See [Gallagher](http://www.tcd.ie/Political_Science/staff/michael_gallagher/ElSystems/Docts/ElectionIndices.pdf) and [Carey & Hix](http://www.dartmouth.edu/~jcarey/Data_Archive.html) for further notes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","tagline":"A .csv file of Gallagher Disproportionality Data","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
